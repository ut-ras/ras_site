# Micromouse - Semester Wrap-Up
## 2020 - Micromouse

We’ve reached an early and unexpected end to our semester. While we were not able to compete this year due to the Coronavirus pandemic, we have made progress on creating a new micromouse. A major modification in the new micromouse is changing the microcontroller from an ESP32 to a TM4C.

Currently, we’ve finalized the schematic and ordered parts. Our priority when we get started again is to finish our PCB layout and order it. We have a lot of work ahead of us, including a lot of programming and assembly. We’re always looking for more members, so if you’re interested in joining Micromouse please talk to a member or email [alljiang@utexas.edu](mailto:alljiang@utexas.edu). We’re looking forward to our next meeting!

# VEXU GHOST - Over Under 2024
<!-- Tone: straightforward, happy, conversational-->

We won the Vex AI World Excellenece Award this year! After a whole year of experimenting with robot mechanisms and autonomy systems, and several years of research on our differential swerve drivetrain and LIDAR+Odometry localization algorithm, we won the highest judged award in the AI division of the VexU Competition that represents excellence in our overall design process and program.

We also had the highest score at the whole tournament, at 156 points. In the Vex AI competition, robots are fully autonomous in a 2-minute 2v2 match where their goal is to score the most points by scoring triballs in the goal, climbing, and strategically preventing your opponents from doing that.

Here are two great matches we played at the Vex AI World Championship (as 1565X):

This is the final state of our robots, after the April-May development cycle for the world championships:
## George

We watched a lot of Seinfeld while building these robots, so our robots are named after characters from the show. The core of George (especially the 3d printed swerve) is modeled in [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/70b7a1ae517b6bf8e2919d3b/w/920e944e8181494d2740434a/e/66846745e2ebff627009c277). Feel free to take a look and learn from our design, we'd love to get feedback and hear about your ideas!

### Climb

We used a linear rail mechanism (bad idea in hindsight). Our claw was designed in Onshape and manufactured by SendCutSend, and it's over-center locking mechanism is pneumatically actuated through a Bowden tube. You might know of Bowden tubes as what transfers force from Bike handles to brakes, but we are one of, if not the first team in the Vex Robotics Competition to use them to transfer pneumatic force to places that don't have the physical space for a piston, like our claw. This lets us make our claw mechanism pack up much more compactly than if it had to directly actuate the claw.

### Differential Swerve Drivetrain

This is the Open Source swerve drive we have been working on for the past few years. It's one of only 3 differential swerves in the VexU competition, and basically allows us to point the wheels in any direction and apply the full power of 8 motors in that direction.

### Localization

The LIDAR + Odometry stack we have been working on for the last few years is finally paying off. The slow data from the LIDAR is combined with the Odometry data from wheel encoders that is fast but prone to error accumulation. We use a combination of Extended Kalman filters and Particle Filters to get an extremely accurate picture of where our robot is in the field. This data can then be used for movement.

### Architecture

All of this fancy code runs on a Jetson Nano. It talks to the Vex Brain over USB Serial, and sends all the screen data, motor data, and receives sensor data from the Vex Brain over this one link. The LIDAR and Realsense for CV connect directly to the Jetson Nano over USB. All our services on the Jetson Nano use ROS to communicate. All our code is [public on GitHub](https://github.com/VEXU-GHOST/VEXU_GHOST).

In addition, over the whole season, we have been working hard to make all the robot behavior runtime configurable. This means that the code doesn't need to be recompiled, and it just reads things like port mappings and autonomous routines from configuration files. This will help with rapid iteration, because compiling code on the Jetson is super slow.

## Jerry Jr.

On Jerry, our tail flapper and olympic level human match loaders let us match load at ridiculous speeds, which is good to avoid defense, and spend our free time playing defense.

Our match loading cycle time was around 750 ms (i.e. 4 balls in 3 seconds). The tail flapper also sent the balls pretty far down the alley, to make it easier to bowl into our goal autonomously.

On the way back, Jerry has a distance sensor sync routine, where it corrects tracking wheel odometry with wall positions using two distance sensors - basically like a cheap primitive LIDAR. All [the code for Jerry](https://github.com/VEXU-GHOST/vexu_tank) runs on the Vex Brain, and we used the Boomerang algorithm from [Lemlib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/), for our motion planning.

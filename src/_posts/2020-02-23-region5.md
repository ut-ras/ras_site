# Region V - Getting Close!
## 2020 - Region V

Region V is competing on April 4th in Oklahoma City!

We are excited to be traveling to Oklahoma soon to take part in the [recycling themed Region V Robotics Competition](https://r5conferences.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/126/Robotics_Game_Manual.pdf). Our team is in the assembly process and knocking down code goal after code goal.

We are focusing on having a quick robot that will collect as much trash as possible in one go around. We have also made a unique change to the orientation of the drive wheels as seen below.

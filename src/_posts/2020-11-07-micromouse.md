# Micromouse November Update
## 2020 - Micromouse

Our hardware team has started PCB layout and developed a preliminary 3D model of the robot to estimate PCB geometry.

We've finished up IR LED testing and we will be focusing on getting the PCB designed!

Our algorithm team is working on the simulator in order to start developing the micromouse decision making code.

Our GUI team has been researching how to create communication protocols and are currently designing their own for interfacing with the micromouse.

If you’d like join, check out the micromouse channel on the UT RAS Microsoft Teams, or contact [alljiang@utexas.edu](mailto:alljiang@utexas.edu). We meet on Saturdays at 7PM on our micromouse Discord server.
